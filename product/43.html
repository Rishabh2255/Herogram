            <p>"Guardians of the Galaxy" is a popular Marvel Comics superhero team that first appeared in comic book form in 1969. The team was created by writer Arnold Drake and artist Gene Colan. Over the years, various iterations of the team have existed, but the most well-known version is the one introduced in 2008 by writer Dan Abnett and artist Andy Lanning, often referred to as the "Modern Guardians of the Galaxy."

                The modern lineup of the Guardians of the Galaxy includes a diverse group of cosmic characters who come together to protect the galaxy from various threats. Some of the core members of the team are:
                
                1. Star-Lord (Peter Quill): The charismatic leader of the group, a human with a troubled past who becomes a skilled spacefaring adventurer.
                
                2. Gamora: An orphaned assassin raised by the villain Thanos, she later turns against him and becomes a member of the Guardians.
                
                3. Drax the Destroyer: Originally a human named Arthur Douglas, he was resurrected as a powerful, vengeance-driven warrior with the sole purpose of destroying Thanos.
                
                4. Rocket Raccoon: A genetically engineered raccoon with exceptional piloting and combat skills, and a penchant for explosives.
                
                5. Groot: A sentient tree-like being and the companion of Rocket, who can only say "I am Groot" but has various meanings behind those words.
                
                6. Mantis: An empath with unique mental abilities who can sense the emotions of others.
                
                The Guardians of the Galaxy are known for their cosmic adventures, humorous banter, and their ability to work together despite their vastly different backgrounds and personalities.
                
                The success of the comic book series inspired a popular Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film adaptation. The "Guardians of the Galaxy" movie was released in 2014, directed by James Gunn. The film's commercial and critical success led to a sequel, "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," released in 2017.
                
                As for the third installment, "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," it was confirmed as part of the MCU's Phase Four. James Gunn returned to direct the film, and it was expected to continue the story of the Guardians and explore their connections to other events in the MCU. However, as previously mentioned, my information is only current up until September 2021, and I do not have details about any developments beyond that date. For the latest news and updates about the "Guardians of the Galaxy" franchise, I recommend checking official Marvel sources or entertainment news outlets.</p>
